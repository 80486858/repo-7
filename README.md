Volunteer Portal is a platform designed to present, track, and report volunteering opportunities. Whether you're a large company, small business, nonprofit, or just a group of amazing people, Volunteer Portal can help you be more active in your community.

## About
### Contributing
We're a small team at [Zendesk](http://zendesk.com/) that volunteer to maintain and launch features. If you'd like to be a regular contributor, please reach out to us on our [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/zendesk-volunteer/shared_invite/enQtNDczNTM5MzEwNjQwLTNmMmI3NzdlNjg4ODc4ZDFmYzBkODljZWQ2NmY0OWM3NDliOTdlMzAzOTdkZTBiYjBmMmQ3ZGFjOTFlMjdlNDk) and we'll be happy to onboard you. Otherwise, we're open to changes - open a pull request for us to review.

### Impact
We use the volunteer portal at [Zendesk](http://zendesk.com/) to record our volunteering hours. We've also had numerous organizations run the portal on their [own infrastructure](./docs/deploy.md).

## Roadmap
You can view future features on our [projects board](https://github.com/zendesk/volunteer_portal/projects).
