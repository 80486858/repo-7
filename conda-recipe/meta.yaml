    description:
        NumPy-based implementation of Fast Fourier Transform using Intel (R) Math Kernel Library.
        Supports in-place and out-of-place, 1D and ND complex FFT on arrays of single and double precision
        with arbitrary memory layout, so long as array strides are multiples of its itemsize.
    summary: NumPy-based implementation of Fast Fourier Transform using Intel (R) Math Kernel Library.
